        <h2>And since you are going to Aarhus here are the promised tips for Denmark! </h2>
        1) The city might be bigger than you actually expect. For easy going around you can use the buses. 
        <br>
        <br>
        2) In Denmark everywhere you can pay by card - it is almost impossible to see danish cash. In order to buy ticket you should download the Middtrafik app. Also to see when is the next bus at your stop you should download the app Middtrafik Live app. Both are pretty easy to use and in English.
        <br>
        <br>
        3) Bikes are everywhere! Be aware of that and really pay attention while walking or crossing the streets! 
        <br>
        <br>
        4) Danes are really direct. They can not be impressed by fluffy words and kind regards, they will be    extremelly appreciative if you tell them directly what you want and do not waste their time.
        <br>
        <br>
        5) People just do not make eye contact and that's it!
